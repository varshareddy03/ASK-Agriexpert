                        <p >
                            Crop rotation is the practice of planting different crops sequentially on the same plot of land to improve soil health, optimize nutrients in the soil, and combat pest and weed pressure.
                            Say a farmer has planted a field of corn. When the corn harvest is finished, he might plant beans, since corn consumes a lot of nitrogen and beans return nitrogen to the soil.
                            If a farmer plants the exact same crop in the same place every year,she continually draws the same nutrients out of the soil. Pests and diseases happily make themselves a 
                            permanent home as their preferred food source is guaranteed.
                            Crop rotation helps return nutrients to the soil without synthetic inputs.
                            The practice also works to interrupt pest and disease cycles,increase biodiversity on the farm.

                        <p >
                            Cover crops are different from cash crops, which are those that a farmer sells for profit, such as corn or soybeans.
                            Cover crops’ primary job is to improve the soil. They get planted in fields that would otherwise be bare—in between growing seasons, for example—to protect the soil from erosion and nutrient loss.
                            Cover crops also help smother weeds, control pests and diseases, enhance water availability, and increase biodiversity on the farm. Conventional farmers rely on synthetic fertilizers and chemical 
                            herbicides to return nutrients to their soils and fight weeds. Cover crops come to rescue.

                        <p >
                            Intercropping is the practice of growing two or more crops in proximity. The most common goal of intercropping is to produce a greater yield on a given piece of land by making use of resources that would otherwise not be utilized by a single crop.
                            The major benefits of intercropping are:
                            <ul>
                            <li> Added nutrients for the main crop </li>
                            <li> controlling weeds </li>
                            <li>Increased Profit</li>
                            <li>More efficient use of natural resources</li>

                        <p >
                            Vermicomposting is a natural process whereby earthworms convert waste material with rigid structures into compost.
                            Vermicompost is a nutrient-rich fertilizer as well as a soil conditioner. It has been shown to increase plant growth and yield as well as suppressing key pests and diseases of horticultural plants in the greenhouse and in field soils. 
                            Vermicompost is generally of finer structure, contains more plant available nutrients, has higher microbial activity, and possesses better plant growth promoting properties than conventionally produced thermophilic compost.

                        <p >
                            Contour ploughing is the practice of following the contours of the land when ploughing. This method is used to prevent soil erosion and 
                            to make the most of the land’s potential.Contour ploughing is especially important at the beginning of the rainy season when biological conservation effects are poor. The benefits of contour ploughing include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reduced water runoff</li>

                        <p >
                            Agroforestry integrates crops, trees and livestock in the same area and at the same time. 
                            Together these components can create long-lasting sustainable farming practices which can provide 
                            short-, medium-, and long-range economic, environmental and social benefits for farmers.
                            Agroforestry systems have the potential to be more beneficial than traditional agriculture and forest production practices. They may be able to give 
                            enhanced productivity, as well as social, economic, and environmental advantages, as well as a broader variety of ecological products and services.

                        <p >
                            Rotational grazing is the practice of containing and moving animals through pasture to improve soil, plant, and animal health.
                            Left alone on a patch of land, animals like cattle and hogs can quickly destroy all signs of life, compacting the soil as they go. However, 
                            if the animals are managed with rotational grazing, the soil sees big returns. Grazing encourages plants to send out more and deeper roots. 
                            Those roots are continually sloughed off to decompose in the ground, boosting soil biomass and fertility and sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. 
                            Rotational grazing also helps prevent erosion and agriculture runoff.
